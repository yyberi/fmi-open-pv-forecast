## Project Overview

This project has been modified to automatically fetch solar forecasts and store them in an InfluxDB database. Key components:

* **`get_forecast.py`**: Contains the updated code for fetching forecasts and writing to InfluxDB.
* **`deploy.sh`**: Packages required files and syncs them to the target device.
* **`run_task.sh`**: Builds the Docker container and runs the forecast task.
* **Cron Setup**: Instructions below show how to schedule the task with cron.

## Automatic Scheduling with Cron

### Setup Steps

1. Ensure `run_task.sh` (in project root) is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_task.sh
   ```
2. Open your crontab:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
3. Add a line to run the task at 10 minutes past 0, 6, 12, and 15 hours:

   ```cron
   10 0,6,12,15 * * * cd /home/tero/services/pv-forecast && ./run_task.sh >> pv-forecast.log 2>&1
   ```

   * To change the minute, replace `10` with your desired value (e.g. `35`).
   * Logs are appended to `pv-forecast.log`.

### Optional: Cron Environment

If you need Bash-specific features or a custom PATH, add at the top of your crontab:

```cron
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

# ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION:

# FMI Open PV Forecast
**Last update 2024-11-28**

## Description
Python code for predicting the output from a solar PV installation at given coordinates and panel installation angles. 
FMI Open Data weather forecast is taken as input for the PV calculations. The intention of this project is to offer a 
configurable solar PV forecast model for PV installation operators within the geographic area covered by FMI open data
show in https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/numerical-weather-prediction. 

This application relies on models and research by the international scientific community, in addition to specific studies done at FMI:

- PV estimation model as described by Huld et al. (2010) and utilized also by the Joint Research Centre’s PVGIS 
service (https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/)
- PV related tools available in the PVlib Python package
- Testing this PV model and Numerical Weather Prediction based PV forecasting in Finnish conditions (Böök et al., 2020; Böök & Lindfors, 2020)

## Features
- Adjustable simulation parameters:
    - Geolocation.
    - Panel angles.
    - Temporal resolution.
    - Installation size.
    - Wind speed and air temperature.
- The model takes into account the following radiation sources:
  - Direct radiation. Modeled with DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance).
  - Atmosphere scattered radiation. Modeled with DHI (Diffuse Horizontal radiance).
  - Ground reflected radiation. Modeled with GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance).
- Losses and efficiency variation due to:
  - Panel reflectivity.
  - Panel temperature (including panel temperature modeling based on weather data from FMI Open Data).
  - Variable ground albedo (with FMI Open Data).
  - Atmopsheric aerosols and ozone (with FMI Open Data).

- Plotting:
    - PVlib based clear sky energy output forecast.
    - FMI Open Data based weather forecast-aware energy output forecast.
    - Combined plotting:
      - Shows the theoretical maximum generation and weather-model-based generation side by side.
      - Estimates kWh generation per day.
- Exporting:
  - Output and irradiance data can be exported as a .CSV -file by setting save_csv to True in config.py 

## Forecast accuracy
The components of the PV model are built upon proven and widely validated scientific studies. 
If the code is free of errors, the PV model pipeline is expected to perform with an accuracy
comparable to the best existing scientific models available as of 2024.

The accuracy of the PV forecasts generated by this application are thus highly dependent on irradiance forecasts from 
FMI open. In preliminary testing, accuracy for the first two days appears to be fairly high and dropping after that. In 
addition, accuracy is also dependent on local conditions, frost, snow, shading and other factors which are currently 
not implemented.

Further validification and model testing has been planned for the upcoming months.

## Software requirements
In order to run the program, you need a python environment with python 3.11 or newer and the following packages:
* fmiopendata >=0.4.3
* matplotlib >=3.9.2
* numpy >=2.1.1
* pandas >=2.2.2
* pvlib >=0.11.0

A python virtual environment (venv) or similar is recommended.




## Generating a new plot
1. Open config.py and set panel angles, geolocation and rated power to match the simulated installation.

2. Run function combined_processing_of_data() inside file main.py. This function will execute by default if main.py is not modified.

3. Open generated plot from folder "output". By default, the plot is saved into output folder inside the program directory. File names follow the structure "output/installation_name-rundate runtime_utc.png".


## Reading the plot
![Solar PV model flowchart](documentation_pictures/pv_forecast_plot_example.png)

Simulated PV output should resemble the following picture. Dark blue line marks the weather-model-based generation in both
line and bar charts, whereas the lighter blue corresponds to a theoretical cloud-free power output estimate.

Dashed vertical line (1) marks the simulation runtime. This time is the same as the timestamp in plot title.

During predicted cloudy or partially cloudy days(2) the weather-model-based generation is lower than theoretical cloud-free generation.

During predicted cloud-free days(3) both estimates should be within a small margin of one another. 
The deviation between models can increase depending on aerosol load of the atmosphere, 
water vapor and total ozone column, and other factors potentially influencing the solar radiation reaching the assumed PV installation.

Weather-model-based DNI, DHI, GHI are available from FMI Open Data for a 66-hour period from the initial time of the model run. 
This means that the line for estimated output stops on either 3rd or 4th day depending on simulation runtime. 
Stopping point marked as (4). The code uses MetCoOp numerical weather prediction available through FMI Open Data. 
Forecast initial times are 00 UTC, 03 UTC, 06 UTC, and so on, and a new forecast typically becomes available around three hours after the initial time.  

The bar chart contains a comparison of theoretical cloud-free and theoretical clear sky PV output. 
In (5) the estimated PV output is marked as 114kWh,
which is 69% of the ~165kWh power generation estimated by the clear sky model. 
This estimate is calculated based on the data period available from FMI Open Data, meaning that power generation before 
simulation runtime(1) is included in the data for the first day.

**Notes:** 
- The forecast represents a somewhat ideal monofacial PV system, with a perfect open horizon, standard assumed losses and no snow accumulated on the panels. Real PV systems may deviate from this for various reasons. Such reasons include, for example:
  - Shadows cast by trees and other structures.
  - Snow on top of the panels decreasing the PV production.
  - System-specific losses aren't accounted for properly.
- Weather forecasts are uncertain to some extent.
- FMI Open Data values are expected hourly averages.
- The forecast has been tested on real PV data from FMI’s Helsinki and Kuopio sites. 
Some comparison plots are available in directory /documentation_picture/measured_vs_forecasted. 
These installations are located on flat rooftops without major shadowing. 
The results show good agreement with actual PV output during cloud-free days. For cloudy days, the forecast is typically more uncertain, but still fairly good.
- The PV efficiency model (Huld model) can produce negative efficiency values when irradiance is low. This was remedied by setting an efficiency limit in ouput_estimator.py.

## Troubleshooting



**Issue:** 

Simulated generation is higher than the real output of my system.

**Solutions:**
  * Check that system power rating and panel angles are correct in config.py
  * PV panels degrade over time -> Adjust rated_power in config.py to be a lower value.
  * Panels may be dusty -> Wash panels or wait for rain to do it for you.
  * Wind may cool the panels less than the model suggests, and the increased temperature may be decreasing efficiency. -> Set a lower than actual module elevation in
config.py


**Issue:**

Real generation is higher than simulated output.

**Solutions:**
  * Check that system power rating and panel angles are correct in config.py
  * Reflections from clouds can increase PV output if direct sunlight is not blocked. -> No changes needed, this is just challenging to model, and this should not occur often.
  * Real panel temperature might be colder than modeled panel temperature. -> No solutions. This would require model adjustments.

**Issue:**

I am using bifacial panels or panels with multiple installation angles, and the program does not appear to support my system.

**Solution:**

Adding support for bifacial and mixed angle installations would be fairly easy, and may be added in the future if requested. Reach out to us and we'll consider adding support.



### Changes 2024-10-09:
- Initial open source publication.

### Changes 2024-11-19:
- Implemented code optimizations to the PV model which make the model orders of magnitude faster.
- Some older slow functions have been removed and new functions with "_fast" suffix have been added in their place.
- New "__testing.py" -file in the main directory. Debugging and testing functions should be written there instead of in main.py.
This way some testing functions can be left in the program for advanced users without making main.py more complicated
than it has to be.
- Measured runtimes for every part of the program. Program runtime appears to now be defined by the speed of matplotlib and FMI open data.


### TODO:
* Bifacial/multi angle support if requested by users.
* Timezone conversions.
* Wind speed and air temperature biases for local adjustments.
